## Introduction

When I started my self-hosting journey, one of the biggest challenges was setting up reliable infrastructure that could handle multiple services, automatic SSL certificates, and dynamic DNS updates. After trying various combinations, I settled on a powerful trio: **pfSense** for routing and firewall, **Cloudflare** for DNS management, and **Caddy** for reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS.

This setup has been rock-solid for over a year, handling my [Standard Notes](/blog/self-host-standard-notes), [Immich](https://immich.app/), and various other self-hosted applications. In this guide, I'll walk you through exactly how to replicate this infrastructure.

For this guide let's assume you have Immich installed on your server running at `192.168.1.11:2283` and you want to access it from the internet at `immich.domain.com` and you have caddy running on your server running at `192.168.1.100`.

## Architecture Overview

Here's what we're building:

```
Internet → Cloudflare DNS → pfSense Router → Caddy Reverse Proxy → Your Services
```

**Key Components:**
- **pfSense**: Acts as router, firewall, and DHCP server
- **Cloudflare**: Manages DNS records with automatic updates
- **Caddy**: Reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- **Dynamic DNS**: Keeps your home IP address synchronized with Cloudflare

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need:
- A domain name (can be purchased through Cloudflare or transferred)
- pfSense installed and configured as your router/firewall
- Immich (or another service) running on your local network
- A server/VM for running Caddy (I use Proxmox)
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works fine)

## Part 1: Cloudflare DNS Setup

### Step 1: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare

1. **Create a Cloudflare account** at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. **Add your domain** by clicking "Add a Site"
3. **Choose the Free plan** (sufficient for most self-hosting needs)
4. **Update your domain's nameservers** to point to Cloudflare's nameservers

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records

If you already have DNS records, you'll need to transfer any existing records to Cloudflare.

```
Type    Name              Content
A       @                 YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
A       *                 YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
CNAME   www               domain.com
```

### Step 3: Add Your Subdomain

Before setting up dynamic DNS in pfSense, we need to create the subdomain record in Cloudflare first:

1. **Navigate to DNS** → **Records** in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. **Click Add record**
3. **Configure the record**:
   - **Type**: A
   - **Name**: immich (this will create immich.domain.com)
   - **IPv4 address**: 1.1.1.1 (temporary placeholder)
   - **Proxy status**: DNS only (gray cloud - disabled)
   - **TTL**: Auto

4. **Save the record**

**Note**: We're using 1.1.1.1 as a placeholder IP address for now. pfSense will automatically update this with your real public IP address once we configure dynamic DNS.

### Step 4: Get Cloudflare API Token

We need an API token for pfSense to update DNS records automatically:

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Profile** → **API Tokens**
2. You'll need a Global API Key or API token with DNS edit permission on the provided zone.

**Note**: You can use the Global API Key or create a specific API token with DNS edit permission on the provided zone. It's recommended to create a specific API token with DNS edit permission on the provided zone.


## Part 2: pfSense Configuration

Assuming you already have pfSense installed and running with basic WAN/LAN configuration, we'll focus on the specific settings needed for our self-hosting infrastructure.

### Step 1: Configure Dynamic DNS

This is where the magic happens - pfSense will automatically update your Cloudflare DNS records when your public IP changes. We need to create a dynamic DNS entry for our Immich subdomain.

1. **Navigate to Services** → **Dynamic DNS**
2. **Click Add** to create a new dynamic DNS entry
3. **Configure the settings**:

```
Service Type: Cloudflare
Interface to Monitor: WAN
Hostname: immich
Domain: domain.com
Cloudflare Proxy: Enabled Proxy
Username: YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL
Password: YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
Description: Immich Photo Management
```

**Note**: "Cloudflare Proxy: Enabled Proxy" means traffic will be proxied through Cloudflare's CDN, providing DDoS protection and caching.

4. **Save the entry** and test the configuration
5. **Check the Status** tab to ensure it's working
6. The DNS record should now be updated with your real public IP address instead of 1.1.1.1

Should look like this:

### Step 2: Port Forwarding

Set up port forwarding to direct traffic to your Caddy server:

1. **Navigate to Firewall** → **NAT** → **Port Forward**
2. **Add port forwarding rules** for HTTP and HTTPS:

Configure your port forwarding like this:

**HTTPS Port Forward:**
- **Interface**: WAN
- **Address Family**: IPv4
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Destination**: WAN address
- **Destination Port Range**: HTTPS (443)
- **Redirect Target IP**: Your Caddy server IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- **Redirect Target Port**: HTTPS (443)
- **Description**: Forward HTTPS to Caddy

**HTTP Port Forward:**
- **Interface**: WAN
- **Address Family**: IPv4
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Destination**: WAN address
- **Destination Port Range**: HTTP (80)
- **Redirect Target IP**: Your Caddy server IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- **Redirect Target Port**: HTTP (80)
- **Description**: Forward HTTP to Caddy

Your configuration should look like this:

## Part 3: Caddy Configuration

For this setup, you'll need Caddy running somewhere on your network. I'm running it on my Proxmox server in an LXC container. Which I installed using the [Proxmox Helper Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=caddy).

### Step 1: Basic Caddyfile Configuration

**If your using Proxmox like me, open the terminal in the container and run the following commands:**

```bash
nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Create or edit the Caddyfile at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
# Immich photo management
immich.domain.com {
	reverse_proxy 192.168.1.11:2283
}
```

Save with `CTRL + O` and exit with `CTRL + X`.

This simple configuration tells Caddy to:
- Listen for requests to `immich.domain.com`
- Automatically obtain and manage SSL certificates
- Forward requests to your Immich server at `192.168.1.11:2283`

Format and validate your Caddyfile:
```bash
sudo caddy fmt --overwrite /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

### Step 2: Enable and Start Caddy

```bash
# If it's the initial setup
sudo systemctl enable caddy

# If you're adding or changing services
sudo systemctl start caddy

# Check status
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

You can view the logs with:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u caddy.service
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. **Wait for DNS propagation** useally pretty quick but if it's not working try again in a few minutes.
2. **Visit your Immich instance**: `https://immich.domain.com`
   - You should see the Immich login page
   - The connection should be secure (HTTPS)
3. **Check SSL certificate**: Should show as valid Let's Encrypt certificate
4. **Monitor Caddy logs** for any issues:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u caddy.service -f
   ```

## Adding More Services

Once you have this basic setup working with Immich, adding additional services is straightforward:

1. **Add a new dynamic DNS entry** in pfSense for each new subdomain
2. **Add the service configuration** to your Caddyfile:
   ```caddyfile
   # Add more services here
   nextcloud.domain.com {
       reverse_proxy 192.168.1.12:80
   }

   homeassistant.domain.com {
       reverse_proxy 192.168.1.13:8123
   }
   ```
3. **Reload Caddy** to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload caddy
   ```

The infrastructure you've built will automatically handle SSL certificates and DNS updates for any new services you add.

## Conclusion

This infrastructure setup has served me incredibly well for self-hosting multiple services. The combination of pfSense, Cloudflare, and Caddy provides:

- **Reliability**: Automatic DNS updates and SSL certificate management
- **Security**: Robust firewall, DDoS protection, and automatic HTTPS
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services with minimal configuration
- **Maintainability**: Automated updates and clear monitoring

The initial setup requires some effort, but once configured, it easy to add more services.
