## Introduction

Transforming an old Intel NUC into a virtualization powerhouse with Proxmox VE was a fun project. These little machines are perfect for home labs because they're small and pack enough punch. Here's how I installed Proxmox on my Intel NUC, hopefully it helps you out.

## Preparation

### What You'll Need

Before starting, I made sure I had everything I needed:

- **Old Intel NUC:** I used a model with a 64-bit Intel processor with virtualization support (VT-x), 8 GB of RAM, and a 120 GB SSD. This is plenty for running a few virtual machines.
- **Bootable USB Drive:** A 4 GB USB flash drive is all you need.
- **Proxmox VE ISO:** I downloaded the latest Proxmox VE ISO from the [Proxmox download page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads). I also verified the checksum to make sure the download was good.
- **Internet Connection:** You'll need this for updates and managing remote repositories.

### Creating the Installation Media

With the ISO file downloaded, the next step was to create a bootable USB drive:

1. **Using Rufus for USB Drive Creation:**

- I downloaded and launched [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), a great tool for creating bootable USB drives.
- I plugged in the USB stick and selected it in Rufus.
- I chose the Proxmox VE ISO file using the "Select" button.
- I set the partition scheme to MBR and the file system to FAT32.
- After clicking "Start," Rufus did its thing and made the USB drive bootable.

## Booting from the USB Drive

### Setting Up the Intel NUC

With the installation media ready, it was time to set up the Intel NUC:

1. **Inserting the USB Drive:**

- I plugged the bootable USB drive into one of the front USB ports of the NUC.

2. **Accessing BIOS/UEFI:**

- As the NUC started up, I pressed the F2 key to get into the BIOS setup.

3. **Configuring the Boot Order:**

- I went to the "Boot" tab in the BIOS settings.
- I changed the boot order to make the USB drive the first boot device.

4. **Saving Changes and Rebooting:**

- I saved the changes and exited the BIOS. The NUC rebooted and the Proxmox installer started.

## Installing Proxmox VE

### Going Through the Installation Steps

With the Proxmox installer running, I followed these steps:

1. **Proxmox Boot Menu:**

- I selected "Install Proxmox VE" from the boot menu and pressed Enter.

2. **Agreeing to the License:**

- The installer shows the Proxmox VE license agreement. I accepted the terms to continue.

3. **Selecting the Target Hard Disk:**

- I chose the NUC's internal SSD for the installation. This erases all data on the drive, so be careful.

4. **Filesystem Options:**

- Proxmox VE supports ext4, XFS, BTRFS, and ZFS. I went with ext4 because it's stable and widely used.
- If you use ZFS, don't use it on top of hardware RAID. The Proxmox wiki has more info on this.

5. **Configuring Regional Settings:**

- I set my region, time zone, and keyboard layout.

6. **Setting Password and Email:**

- I created a strong password for the root account and entered my email for system notifications.

7. **Network Configuration:**

- I used a static IP configuration for my home network.
- I entered the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers.

8. **Starting the Installation:**

- After confirming all the settings, I clicked "Install." The installation took about 10-15 minutes.

9. **Rebooting into Proxmox:**

- Once the installation was done, I removed the USB drive and rebooted the NUC.

## Accessing the Proxmox Web Interface

### Final Steps to Get Proxmox Running

With Proxmox installed, I could now access the web interface:

1. **Accessing the Web Interface:**

- On my laptop, I opened a web browser and went to `https://<assigned_IP>:8006`.

2. **Handling the Security Warning:**

- I got a security warning because of the self-signed SSL certificate. I added a security exception to continue.

3. **Logging In:**

- I logged in with the root username and password.

4. **Post-Install Configuration:**

- I checked the IP configuration, hostname, timezone, and firewall settings.

5. **Updating Proxmox:**

- I went to the "Updates" section, clicked "Refresh," and then "Upgrade" to install the latest updates.

6. **Changing to Community Repository (Optional):**

- If you don't have a Proxmox subscription, you'll need to switch to the community repository.
- You can do this manually or use the [Proxmox Helper Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install).

Manual method:
First, edit the Ceph repository:
```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

Comment out the enterprise lines:
```plaintext
#deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-quincy bookworm enterprise
```

Then, edit the PVE repository:
```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

Comment out the enterprise lines:
```plaintext
#deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise
```

- After updating the repositories, run `apt update` and `apt upgrade -y`.

## Conclusion

Turning my old Intel NUC into a Proxmox server was a great experience. It's a fantastic way to give old hardware a new purpose and learn about virtualization.

If you have an old device, give it a try. You can unlock its potential and dive into the world of virtual machines. Happy virtualizing!
